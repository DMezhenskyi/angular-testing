## Course Projects

The course project consists of 2 sub-projects:
- *ui-kit* - A components library for the course section **Angular Testing Basics**.

- `npm run build --project ui-kit -- --watch` to run component library build in watch mode.
- `npm run start` to start the **ui-kit-demoapp**, which is used as a showcase for the library's components, directives, pipes, etc.
